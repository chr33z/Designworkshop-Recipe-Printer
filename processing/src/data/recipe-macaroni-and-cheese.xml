	<preparation>
		Preheat
		<equipment>oven</equipment>
		to 450 F. Cook macaroni
		until it is almost tender. Drain and rinse thorougly with cold water. Melt
		butter in a
		<equipment>3-quart saucepan</equipment>
		over medium-low heat.
		Slowly add flour, stiring constantly, to make a roux. When roux begins to
		darken in color slowly add the milk and keep stiring even though it
		may feel
		as if your arm will fall off at any minute. Add cream cheese and salt
		stirring until the sauce has a smooth and creamy texture. Fold
		macaroni into
		the sauce. Place 1/3 of the macaroni and sauce mixture into a buttered
		<equipment>8 x 8 inch pan</equipment>
		. Top with a layer of cheddar cheese
		slices. Scoop another 1/3 of the macaroni mixture into the pan. Top with
		baby Swiss slices. Add the remaining macaroni mixture to the pan and top
		with the last of the cheddar slices. Bake at 450 for 15 minutes or
		until top
		begins to brown.
	</preparation>

	<serving>Serve alone or with a thick slice of smoked ham. Refrigerate
		leftovers immediately.</serving>

	<notes>It is very important to avoid aged cheeses as these tend to make
		the
		sauce gritty. Sharp cheddar or Swiss will ruin the texture.</notes>
