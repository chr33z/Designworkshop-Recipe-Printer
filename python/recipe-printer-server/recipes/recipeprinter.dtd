This dtd was originally created by David Horton and taken from
http://www.happy-monkey.net/recipebook/recipebook.dtd.

It is modified to fit our needs. We added the <tag> element to define
categories for each recipe and a <pretimeutc> element to add a time in milliseconds
to the xml (this is for processing reasons only).
