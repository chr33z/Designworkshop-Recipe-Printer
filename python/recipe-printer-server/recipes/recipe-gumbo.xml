  <preparation>Create a roux by mixing oil and flour in a <equipment>3-quart
  saucepan</equipment> over medium heat. Stir often with a <equipment>wire
  whisk</equipment> until the roux becomes the color of peanut butter. Add
  onion, celery and green pepper. Be very careful as the roux is very hot and
  tends to splatter when the veggies hit it. Trade the wisk for a
  <equipment>large spoon</equipment> and stir often. When the onion begins to
  turn translucent add tomatoes and okra. As tomatoes and okra soften add the
  chicken and pork. The mixture will be very thick at this point, so add a
  little chicken stock as needed to make stiring less of a chore. When the
  chicken and pork are slightly browned add the remaining chicken stock and
  bring to a boil. Stir in all of the spices, cover the pot and reduce heat to
  a simmer. If the shrimp is frozen add it now otherwise wait until ten
  minutes before serving. Salt acording to taste. Add the rice to boiling
  water in a <equipment>1-quart saucepan</equipment>, reduce heat to low and
  cook for 25 minutes or according to package directions.</preparation>

  <serving>Place a ladle full of gumbo in a bowl and top with a couple
  spoonfuls of rice. Garnish with parsley if you're into the whole
  presentation thing.</serving>

  <notes>When saving leftovers store the gumbo and rice separately at least
  until both are completely cooled, otherwise the rice will get mushy.</notes>
